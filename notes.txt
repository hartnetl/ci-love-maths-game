### Just some helpful notes to take as we go along

#
In CSS " transition: all 0.5s; " changes the speed of the changes you're making.
This is used here when the buttons are clicked, to slow down the colour change to make it smoother.

#
::before and ::after pseudo selectors insert content before/after the targetted element.
In this website it makes the text appear below the buttons for the maths signs.

#
Each function should  ideally have only one main task.   
We want them to be fairly atomic, this is something  known as the single responsibility principle.  
Where we have a collection of smaller  functions each with one main job,  
rather than one huge function handling everything.

#
Always have a clear idea of what you want your site/app to look like - have good wireframes.
They are essential for structure and design. 

The same is true for your functions - Before you begin to code your JS you need to work out exactly what functions you need, 
and what they need to do.
